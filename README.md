# THE MOVIES SAGA

## Description

Duration: 1-week sprint.

This app displays the titles and posters of movies contained in a database. When a movie's poster is clicked, the user is taken to a details page where they see not only the title and poster, but also a description and list of genres.

# Prerequisites

Node, React, Postgres

## Installation

1. Create a database using the instructions and data in database.sql. (Postgres required, Postico recommended.)
2. Open your code editor of choice and run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run server` in your terminal.
4. Run `npm run client` in your terminal.  This will open a browser tab for you!

## Usage

Click any movie poster to be taken to a view of its details. On that page, a button at the bottom will bring you back to the main list.
